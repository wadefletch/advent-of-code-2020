# Advent of Code 2020
These are my honestly pretty terrible solutions to the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

My goal each day is to beat [Christian](http://fergusch.sh/) and [Hazel](https://knightsofthelambdacalcul.us/), not to have the cleanest code, though I have cleaned up/abstracted some particularly heinous solutions.

I've imposed the limitation on myself not to use any third party libraries, so I've thrown the Graph and Queue classes I built for specific solutions in the common module.

To run a specific day's solution, use the following one-liner.
```sh
cd 08 && python solution.py
```
